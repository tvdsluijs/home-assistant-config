# Description: This general file for sensors contains some ... general sensors\


#This part sets up a derivative sensor in Home Assistant to calculate the rate of gas usage. 
# It measures how much gas is used per minute, providing insight into gas consumption over time.
- platform: derivative
  source: sensor.p1_meter_3c39e72a602e_total_gas  # Source sensor for total gas usage
  name: gas_meter_per_min  # Name of the derivative sensor
  round: 3  # Rounds the value to 3 decimal places
  unit_time: min  # Sets the unit of time for the rate calculation to minutes
  unit: 'mÂ³/min'  # Unit of measurement for the sensor (cubic meters per minute)
  time_window: "00:01:00"  # Time window for calculating the derivative (1 minute)
